# IMDb Rating Prediction
The IMDb database is used to train a model that predicts the average rating of movies.
[IMDb datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) have to be downloaded separately and are expected to be stored in the same folder as the notebook.

The whole model building process is documented in the [notebook](imdb-rating-prediction.ipynb).
